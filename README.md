# -Collatz-conjecture
performs  Collatz conjecture
Write a program to explore the Collatz conjecture. Starting with any positive integer, if it is even, divide it by 2; if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process, and the conjecture suggests that you will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of the starting integer. Read a starting integer from the user and display the number of steps required to reach 1.
